    "Ordinal" : "Categorical data that has an explicit ordering. (Synonym: ordered factor)",

    "Poisson distribution" : "The frequency distribution of the number of events in sampled units of time or space.",

    "Exponential distribution" : "The frequency distribution of the time or distance from one event to the next event.",

    "PDF (Probability Density Function)" : " continuous; gives density",

    "PMF (Probability Mass Function)" : "discrete; gives actual probabilities.",

    "CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function)" : "probability a value is ≤ x.",

    "PPF (Percent Point Function)" : "inverse of CDF",

    "p-value" : "Probability of getting your observed results (or more extreme) if the null hypothesis is true.",

    "Critical Value" : "A threshold beyond which we reject the null hypothesis. Based on significance level (e.g., 0.05).",

    "F-test / ANOVA / f_oneway" : "Tests whether means of multiple groups are different. Assumes normality and equal variances across groups.",

    "ANCOVA" : "Analysis of Covariance: Combines ANOVA and regression. Tests group differences while controlling for covariates.",

    "Confidence Interval (CI)" : "A range that likely contains the true population parameter. Often 95% CI → 'we're 95% confident the true value lies within this interval.'",

    "Type I and Type II Errors" : "Type I error (False Positive): Rejecting a true null hypothesis. Type II error (False Negative): Failing to reject a false null hypothesis. Important for understanding p-values and statistical power.",

   "Power of a Test" : "Probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis (1 - Type II error). Tied to sample size, effect size, and significance level.",

   "Prior, Likelihood, Posterior" : "Prior: Belief about a parameter before seeing data. Likelihood: How well data fits a parameter. Posterior: Updated belief after seeing data (via Bayes' Theorem).",

   "Effect size" : "'How big is the effect?'Not just is there a difference, but how meaningful is it?",
   
   "Inertia" : "How far samples are from their centroids",

   "F. Scott Fitzgerald" : "The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposing ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function."
